<h2>Welcome My Web!</h2>
<p>
I am from the 19th class of computer science and technology at Xi'an University of Technology. I am still very interested in programming. I like to talk with some like-minded people to study some things we are interested in, both learning and entertainment. in this way. I think programming is a very interesting thing. If you think about some small problems in your life with code ideas, it's actually quite interesting.
